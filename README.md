## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

    * Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
    * The page will reload if you make edits.
    * You will also see any lint errors in the console.
      
* `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

    * See the section about running tests for more information.
      
* `npm run build`: Builds the app for production in the build folder.

    * It bundles React correctly in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.
    * The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
    * Your app is ready for deployment!
      
* `npm run eject`: If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.

    * This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
    * __Note__: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!
